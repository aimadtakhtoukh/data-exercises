# Exercise 4 : First filters

### Exercise

Usually, we load data mostly to work on it, mostly by cleaning the data and getting what we need first.

Please create SparkApp.filteredDataframe, which takes the earlier dataframe made from the CSV file and only keeps "Fruit and Vegetables" data from 2008.

You can find a few examples of how to do that here : https://sparkbyexamples.com/spark/spark-dataframe-where-filter/

### Clean-up

You can see a correction by running `cmtc pull-solution`.

When you're ready, run `cmtc next-exercise` to load the next exercise.
