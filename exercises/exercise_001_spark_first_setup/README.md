# Exercise 1 : Spark

### Setup

First, build.sbt has been updated, so run `sbt reload` to get the spark library.

### Exercise

First, we're going to run a first spark cluster, locally. 

Create `example.SparkApp.spark`, a function that creates a local `SparkSession`.

You can find out how reading here : https://sparkbyexamples.com/spark/sparksession-explained-with-examples/

### Clean-up

You can see a correction by running `cmtc pull-solution`.

Don't forget to run `docker compose down` before running `ctmc next-exercise`.
