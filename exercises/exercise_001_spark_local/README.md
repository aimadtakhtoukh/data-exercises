# Exercise 1 : Spark local cluster

### Setup

First, build.sbt has been updated, so run `sbt reload` to get the spark library.

### Exercise

First, we're going to run a first spark cluster, locally. It allows you to run and test Spark code without needing to run a full cluster. You're still limited with the RAM space on your computer, and the number of cores in your CPU.

Please create `example.SparkApp.spark`, a function that creates a local `SparkSession`.

### Clean-up

You can see a correction by running `cmtc pull-solution`.
