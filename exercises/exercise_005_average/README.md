# Exercise 5 : Average

### Exercise

Finally, once our data is cleaned, we work to modify it and extract the information we need.

Please create `SparkApp.averageFoodIndexDataframe`, that takes the CSV dataframe and
- filters the "Food" rows, 
- adds a year column, as an integer, 
- and averages the food indexes per year.

You can find a few examples of how to do that here : https://sparkbyexamples.com/spark/using-groupby-on-dataframe/

### Clean-up

You can see a correction by running `cmtc pull-solution`.
