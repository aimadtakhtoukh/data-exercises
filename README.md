# Data exercises in Scala and Spark

### Project

This project is a cmtc-based basic course for learning Spark.

You can install the course by installing cmta and cmtc with Coursier, and run `cmta studentify -m [this folder] -d [path for the course]`.

The Readme for the first exercise will help you setup your environment to follow the course.

### TODO

- Add Kafka and Cassandra exercises to the course, for example those based on the prompts.txt file
- Setup a build to create the zip file needed to allow people to just run `cmtc install`
